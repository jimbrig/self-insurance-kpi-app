# Self Insurance KPI Tracking App

[![Docker](https://github.com/jimbrig/self-insurance-kpi-app/actions/workflows/docker.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jimbrig/self-insurance-kpi-app/actions/workflows/docker.yml)

This app serves as a *Proof of Concept Demo Shiny Application for Tracking KPIs related to P&C Self Insurance*.

In addition to deploying this application as a Shiny Web Application hosted online, it is also compiled into a standalone Desktop Software Executable using Inno to package all the various components included in the bundled desktop app.

For DevOps, GitHub actions is used to continuously build the Docker image on each push and publish to `ghcr.io` for this repo.
